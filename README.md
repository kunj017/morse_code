# morse_code

This is the project file of MORSE_CODE_ENCODER project by CSE 3rd sem students.

# The .circ file of morse code is included and can be run by the following steps:

	Open the file morse_code.circ in Logisim
	Set the frequency of the clock to 2Hz for better view of blinking.
	Select your input (options from 1 to 9), set the shift/load to 1 and see the morse code answer in the output blinker.
	The selection lines send the signal whether the input is 1-9 then it calculates according to the M functions and sends output of 5 bit.
	The output goes one by one to the shift right register.
	With delay, the output signal is displayed and we get dots and dashes.
	This is our final output.
